### Description

Upstash Redis fails to connect to [redis-rs](https://docs.rs/redis/latest/redis/), the most used Redis Rust crate when using a `MultiplexedConnection`, which is the type of connection that is safe to share between multiple threads in Rust.

I've included a vanilla Redis docker image to prove Redis supports `MultiplexedConnection` out of the box.

To bootstrap the demo:

```sh
docker-compose up -d --build && cargo build && cargo run
```

To see the bug with Upstash, change `REDIS_PRIVATE_URL` in `.env` to an Upstash instance.
